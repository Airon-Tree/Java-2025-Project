# Gear Worshipper

A compact LibGDX desktop game where **Hong Lu** duels “gear‑worshipper” robots with bullets, a three‑hit knife combo, and an invulnerable dash.  
The code is self‑contained with Gradle‑driven.
All game resource is from game "Limbus Company"

## 2 Gameplay & Controls

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| **←→↑↓** | Move Hong Lu (full 2‑D) |
| **Z** | Fire revolver (bullet sprite, `gun.wav`) |
| **X** | Knife combo – Slash 1 → 2 → 3 if tapped within **0.4 s** |
| **C** | Dash (0.18 s, 20 m · s⁻¹, invulnerable, damages on contact) |
| **F1** | Toggle head‑only hit‑box overlay (debug) |
| **Esc** | Quit |

HUD (top‑left, large font) shows **HP** (5 max) and **Kills**.  
When HP=0 the screen fades to black and prints:

GAME OVER Total Kills: N

## 3 Implemented Features

| System | Implementation Notes |
|--------|----------------------|
| **Player FSM** | `enum State {STANDING,MOVING,ATTACKING,DAMAGED,DASHING}` + timer; sprite regions swapped per state. |
| **Two‑stage Revolver** | `Bullet` objects stored in an `Array`; move at 24 m/s; collide with head rectangles. |
| **Three‑hit Knife Combo** | Combo window 0.4 s → stage counter 1‑3. Slash 1 is a **2‑frame `Animation`**; damage lands only on frame 2. |
| **Dash** | Single key (**C**): sets `DASHING`, moves at constant speed, invulnerable; one blue rectangle damages gears. |
| **Enemy AI** | Per‑gear FSM (`PURSUE ↔ IDLE ↔ WANDER ↔ DAMAGED`) with timers & random wander vectors. Caps at **4** concurrent gears; respawns on the right edge. |
| **Head‑Only Collision** | All rectangles shrunk (40 % H × 40 % W) to stop “foot hits”. |
| **Sound FX** | 5× `Sound` objects – `slash1.wav`, `slash2.wav`, `slash3.wav`, `gun.wav`, `hurt.wav` – played with individual volume (`sound.play(0.7f)`). |
| **Debug Overlay** | One `ShapeRenderer` draws red (player head), yellow (enemy head), blue (knife/dash) rectangles when **F1** toggled. |
| **Resource Hygiene** | Every `Texture`/`Sound` disposed in `GearGame.dispose()`. |

## 4 Advanced Concepts Highlighted

| Concept | Where It Appears |
|---------|------------------|
| **Finite‑State Machines (FSM)** | Both Hong Lu and each gear are driven by explicit FSMs—a core AI technique also found in GUIs and workflow engines. |
| **Single‑Threaded Game Loop Discipline** | All rendering, input, and logic stay on the LWJGL render thread; Gradle’s background compiler runs separately. Understanding thread confinement avoids `SpriteBatch` errors—mirrors thread‑safety challenges in multi‑threaded servers. |
| **Deterministic Resource Management** | Like dependency‑injection frameworks (e.g., Spring), textures/sounds are created once, “injected” via the constructor, and disposed predictably—similar to managing DB connections or HTTP pools in enterprise apps. |

Found out there are too many people doing Mario Games so I changed my project but it still a game.
